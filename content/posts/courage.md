Lately I've become fascinated with the idea of courage under fear. The kind of courage that people sometimes find in themselves to do great things in incredibly frightening situations. We all hear heroic stories about people rising to the occasion. Stories of a perfect stranger saving the life of a man who fell onto the subway tracks or the firefighter who runs into the burning building after it is totally unsafe to do so to rescue just one more person. This kind of courage under fear is well documented, written about, reported on, and lauded. But the kind of courage that interests me lately isn't this. It's the other kind. The kind that is needed to change, to quit, and to break promises.

We all have idealistic visions of who we want to be in our head. We hold beliefs dearly and tend to consume media that supports our views. During adolescence we fight feverishly to figure things out quickly. We grasp at the air trying desperately to  come up with an opinion about everything because we know that soon we will have to share this opinion in conversation. Typically it's an opinion about a peer, music, or pop cultural event. As we grow into our college years and discover more of the world this is where we tend to form and keep our opinions. It's well documented that the opinions we form during these years are the ones that tend to stay with us though out life and are least likely to change.

What has interested me lately is the courage it takes to change. As we grow older we become more cemented in our ways. With adulthood comes adult responsibilities — careers and bills and mortgages and car payments and children. This makes it harder to change. You've now cultivated an identity. You're known by the traits and beliefs you hold dear. To change those would cause a lot of annoyance, frustration, explanation, etc. on your end. Don't believe me that it is difficult? Try changing your religious or political status on Facebook and see how people react.

Breaking a promise or changing a habit is a difficult process and can have serious ramifications. To change your political beliefs, even just on one issue, can affect your relationship with you're friends, spouse, children, and — in some cases — your career.

What I'm getting at is the insane amount of courage that it takes to change. And it is because it takes so much courage that I think we need to get better at accepting that change in both our friends and ourselves. We need to be willing to accept that we don't stop growing, educating ourselves, learning, and shaping our opinion about the world when we graduate college and start our careers.

What I do not understand is how things got this way. How did we as a society become so opposed to personal change? Why do we discourage and suppress any spark of change in ourselves and our friends past a certain age? I'm not encouraging us to be flaky or non-committal. There is a huge difference between being unable to commit to something and being too afraid to change our views.

I mean if you've got it all figured out already then you're either incredibly smart or incredibly stupid.
