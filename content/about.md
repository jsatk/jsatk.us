## Personal

Hello, my name is Jesse Atkinson.  I write code for a living.  I currently work at [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com).  These days I spend most of my day writing Scala.  For the past decade or so I've been primarily a full-stack web developer focused in JavaScript, HTML, & CSS.  I've worked in just about every popular JS framework.  Outside of work & coding I'm into video games, music, and film and often tweet about them.  I am married to [Lauren Atkinson](https://lettuceandlipgloss.com) who continually challenges me to be [better](http://www.merlinmann.com/better).  I currently live in San Francisco and am originally from Detroit.

In a past life I was a singer, songwriter, and guitarist.  I was in a band called The Jacets for many years.  We put out an EP & a [record](https://open.spotify.com/album/59mTxkzAdjyGFdqh9h5coH?si=9OfdNVJ1RNGMH_WdM9uocA).

## This Website & Tooling

This is my internet home.  I write mostly about technology, but I don't let this stop me from posting about the occasional off topic thing.  I will occasionally write about non-technology things.  Mostly, this website is my attempt at sharing things I've found helpful or interesting that don't fit in a tweet.

This site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with a heavily modified [Coder theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-coder/).  I opted to use a simple CMS & pre-made theme rather than write everything custom myself because I code for a living and don't want to do it in my free time as well.  I write and code everything in [Vim](https://www.vim.org/).  You can see my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/jsatk/dotfiles) if you're curious about how I do computers.

## Contact

Email is best â€“ [jesse[at]jsatk[dot]us](mailto:jesse@jsatk.us).  DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jsatk) is good too.  I also hang out on IRC (in the `#scala` and `#vim` channels mostly).

I love hearing from people (especially if it's to point out a typo in something I wrote).
